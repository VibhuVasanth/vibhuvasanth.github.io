<h1> About me</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Vibhu Vasanth! I am an 8th grader focussed in robotics, and Artificial Intelligence . I love programming and spend a lot of time learning different programming languages. Currently I am learning Python and basic AI concepts. I have participated in quite a few competitions where I displayed my skill and placed them to the test.  Some of which I placed top 5, 3rd as well as 1st place. I am a driven, curious, adaptable,  and eager student who loves to be challenged!
